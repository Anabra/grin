Dead data elimination:
  - for DDE, we assume that node name introduction has already taken place
  - for dummy substitution LVA is sufficient
  - for field deletion, CBy analysis is also required
    - we have to scrutinize every case expression, and group the overlapping producers together
    - in order to be able to delete a field (wtih a given tag), that field must be dead (with the given tag) for all producers in the group
  - when deleting node fields, some expressions might still reference them
  - so we must bind #undefineds to these names to produce semantically valid code 
    (these will be cleaned up by DVE)

Dead parameter elimination:
  - delete dead parameters from function definitions
  - delete the same arguments from function applications as well
  - we have to bind #undefineds to the deleted function parameters inside the function body 
    (see DDE reasoning)

Dead function elimination:
  - a function definition can be removed if its return value and all of its arguments are dead 
  - a parameter can be live even though the return value is dead, if it has some sort of side effect
    e.g.: it's a pointer that is updated, or a side-effecting primop is called on it
  - replace funapp bindings with #undefined (where the function was deleted)
  - when deleting a store, update #undefined types

Dead variable elimination:
  - for (y <- pure x) bindings, delete the binding if y is dead
  - for (y <- fun args) bindings, we can only delete it, if fun's return value and all of its arguments are dead
  - for (x <- fetch p) bindings, delete it if x is dead 
  - for (p <- store x) bindings, delete it if p is dead 
  - for (update p x), delete it if p is dead 
  - when deleting a binding, replace all occurences of the deleted name with #undefined
  - when deleting a store, update #undefined types

Side effects:
  
  DDE:
    - has no effect 
  
  DPE:
    - has no effect 
    - if a parameter is dead, it means that even if it is a pointer, its location will never be used

  DVE:
    - 

TODO:
  HIGH:
    - make sure, that all dead code elimination transfromations handle effectful functions correctly
    - apply inlining should also inline ap
    - implement type safe undefined node generation for tests (Test.Test) 
  
  LOW:
    - implement type env transformation for DDE
    - linter should check whether calculated types match with annotations
    - tests: HeapIndirectSimple -> HeapIndirectComplex ? 
  
  NOTES:
    - before optimising P nodes, make sure to test whether the current optimisations are unable to handle the task

  QUESTIONS:
    - do all P nodes of the same function have the same liveness?
    (even after apply inlining)
    - if they do, can their fields be deleted solely based on the function args' liveness?
  
  if they do:
    - we don't have to introduce new names for them (probably same for F nodes)
    - (args' == args after dde) and (l == no. live args of foo) and (n == no. args'): 
    - PNfoo args --> P(l-n)foo args'
    - if last argument is deleted, then do ... ?

  Indexed store:
    ✔ introduce indexed store AST node @done(18-11-01 21:48)
    - modify dataflow analyses to correctly handle indexed store
    - extend linter so that checks whether indexed stores are used correctly
      - the AST should either contain only non-indexed stores
      - or continously increasing indexed stores starting from 0
