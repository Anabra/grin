Put tests into separate files:
  Why?:
    - do not need to recompile each time a test case is modified
    - data is seprated from functionality
    - a piece of test code can be reused
      - for other tests
      - for playing with it manually (this can be really useful)

  How?:
    - a well structured testing framework is required
    - some prototypes can be find on Anabra/grin:dde-old
