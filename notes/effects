x <- lhs
rhs
flow lhs in to x
flow lhs into the result of rhs (essentially

f x =
  <body>
flow result of <body> into f's result register

case x of
  <alt 1> -> <rhs 1>
  ...
  <alt n> -> <rhs n>
forall i in [1..n]. flow rhs i into the case expression result register



y <- f x WORKS

y <- case x of
  ... ->
    n <- pure 5
    k <- prim_int_print n
    m <- pure 5
    pure n
